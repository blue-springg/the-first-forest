      <p>
        Lately, I’ve been watching a Chinese drama called <strong>The First Frost</strong> — and from the very first scene, it felt like something special.
      </p>
      <p>
        There’s a stillness to it, like fog settling over trees at dawn. It doesn’t shout to be heard — it simply lingers, and you feel it in your chest.
      </p>
      <p>
        After six years apart, Wen Yifan and Sang Yan cross paths again. Once classmates with unspoken feelings and painful misunderstandings, they find themselves unexpectedly sharing the same roof.
      </p>
      <p>
        This drama captures the slow, tender process of rediscovering connection. It’s about patience. It’s about timing. And it’s about the kind of love that feels less like fire and more like roots — steady, deep, and unshakable.
