      After six years apart, Wen Yifan and Sang Yan unexpectedly meet again in a bar. Once classmates, their past is filled with unspoken feelings and painful misunderstandings—Wen Yifan had a crush on Sang Yan, but rejected his feelings, causing distance between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fate brings them under the same roof, where they must confront their past and the fragility of the present. Wen Yifan’s sleepwalking — triggered by family trauma — leads her to Sang Yan’s room, intertwining their lives in unexpected ways.
    </p>

      This drama captures the delicate process of healing and rediscovering love, much like the forest it’s named after — full of quiet strength, mystery, and deep roots.

    <p>
      Watching Wen Yifan’s story made me long for a love that is gentle, patient, and profound — a love that feels like home.
